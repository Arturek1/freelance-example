# Basic example of CQRS with Laravel

Write model: extracted Domain layer with Doctrine

Read model: simple Eloquent

## Known issues

* Project is too small to show the advantages of these patterns
* Applying to job implemented not very correctly in domain(on purpose)
* Read and write entity & controller classes have the same names(not a big problem, they will never be used in same place)
